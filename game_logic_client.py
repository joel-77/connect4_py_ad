    """
    This class implements a GameLogic by delegating all method calls via REST
    to a server (game_logic_server.py). The server in turn delegates the calls
    to a GameLogicLocal object (which is local to the server).

    So the job of this class is to implement the three methods specified in
    GameLogicBase, that is, get_board(), get_state() and drop_token(). Each
    method then invokes the corresponding REST endpoint (which isimplemented
    by the server). It then unpacks the response, and returns the response 
    to the local caller.

    Test programm to manually check if GameLogicClient is working.
    
    NOTE: For the test to work, game_logic_server.py must be implemented and
    running.

    Limitations:
    - Mocks both players (at once):
      - no distributed gameplay possible
      - this is not a replacement for the Coordinator
    - Does not handle errors
    - Does not handle end of game gracefully
